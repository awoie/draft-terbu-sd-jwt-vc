1.  Introduction

1.1.  Issuer-Holder-Verifier Model

   In the so-called Issuer-Holder-Verifier Model, Issuers issue so-
   called Verifiable Credentials to a Holder, who can then present the
   Verifiable Credentials to Verifiers.  Verifiable Credentials are
   cryptographically secured statements about a Subject, typically the
   Holder.

             +-------------+|  Verifiable Credential  +------------+
              +-------------+

    Figure 1: Issuer-Holder-Verifier Model with optional Status Provider

   Verifiers can check the authenticity of the data in the Verifiable
   Credentials and optionally enforce Key Binding, i.e., ask the Holder
   to prove that they are the intended holder of the Verifiable
   Credential, for example, by proving possession of a cryptographic key
   referenced in the credential.  This process is further described in
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt].

   To support revocation of Verifiable Credentials, revocation
   information can optionally be retrieved from a Status Provider.  The
   role of a Status Provider can be fulfilled by either a fourth party
   or by the Issuer.

1.2.  SD-JWT as a Credential Format

   JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) [RFC7519] can in principle be used to express
   Verifiable Credentials in a way that is easy to understand and
   process as it builds upon established web primitives.

   Selective Disclosure JWT (SD-JWT)
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt] is a specification that
   introduces conventions to support selective disclosure for JWTs: For
   an SD-JWT document, a Holder can decide which claims to release
   (within bounds defined by the Issuer).

   SD-JWT is a superset of JWT as it can also be used when there are no
   selectively disclosable claims and also supports JWS JSON
   serialization, which is useful for long term archiving and multi
   signatures.  However, SD-JWT itself does not define the claims that
   must be used within the payload or their semantics.

   This specification uses SD-JWT and the well-established JWT content
   rules and extensibility model as basis for representing Verifiable
   Credentials with JSON payloads.  These Verifiable Credentials are
   called SD-JWT VCs.  The use of selective disclosure in SD-JWT VCs is
   OPTIONAL.

   SD-JWTs VC can contain claims that are registered in "JSON Web Token
   Claims" registry as defined in [RFC7519], as well as public and
   private claims.

   Note: This specification does not utilize the W3C's Verifiable
   Credentials Data Model v1.0, v1.1, or v2.0.

1.3.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

1.4.  Terms and Definitions

   This specification uses the terms "Holder", "Issuer", "Verifier",
   "Key Binding", and "Key Binding JWT" defined by
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt].

   Consumer:  Applications using the Type Metadata specified in
      Section 6 are called Consumer.  This typically includes Issuers,
      Verifiers, and Wallets.
   Verifiable Credential (VC):  An assertion with claims about a Subject
      that is cryptographically secured by an Issuer (usually by a
      digital signature).
   SD-JWT-based Verifiable Credential (SD-JWT VC):  A Verifiable
      Credential encoded using the format defined in
      [I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt].  It may or may not
      contain selectively disclosable claims.
   Unsecured Payload of an SD-JWT VC:  A JSON object containing all
      selectively disclosable and non-selectively disclosable claims of
      the SD-JWT VC.  The Unsecured Payload acts as the input JSON
      object to issue an SD-JWT VC complying to this specification.
   Status Provider:  An entity that provides status information (e.g.
      revocation) about a Verifiable Credential.

2.  Scope

   *  This specification defines
      -  Data model and media types for Verifiable Credentials based on
         SD-JWTs.
      -  Validation and processing rules for Verifiers and Holders.

3.  Verifiable Credentials based on SD-JWT

   This section defines encoding, validation and processing rules for
   SD-JWT VCs.

3.1.  Media Type

   SD-JWT VCs compliant with this specification MUST use the media type
   application/vc+sd-jwt as defined in Appendix A.2.1.

3.2.  Data Format

   SD-JWT VCs MUST be encoded using the SD-JWT format defined in
   Section 5 of [I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt].  A
   presentation of an SD-JWT VC MAY contain a Key Binding JWT.

   Note that in some cases, an SD-JWT VC MAY have no selectively
   disclosable claims, and therefore the encoded SD-JWT will not contain
   any Disclosures.

3.2.1.  JOSE Header

   This section defines JWT header parameters for the SD-JWT component
   of the SD-JWT VC.

   The typ header parameter of the SD-JWT MUST be present.  The typ
   value MUST use vc+sd-jwt.  This indicates that the payload of the SD-
   JWT contains plain JSON and follows the rules as defined in this
   specification.  It further indicates that the SD-JWT is a SD-JWT
   component of a SD-JWT VC.

   The following is a non-normative example of a decoded SD-JWT header:

   {
     "alg": "ES256",
     "typ": "vc+sd-jwt"
   }

3.2.2.  JWT Claims Set

   This section defines the claims that can be included in the payload
   of SD-JWT VCs.

3.2.2.1.  New JWT Claims

3.2.2.1.1.  Verifiable Credential Type - vct Claim

   This specification defines the JWT claim vct (for verifiable
   credential type).  The vct value MUST be a case-sensitive StringOrURI
   (see [RFC7519]) value serving as an identifier for the type of the
   SD-JWT VC.  The vct value MUST be a Collision-Resistant Name as
   defined in Section 2 of [RFC7515].

   A type is associated with rules defining which claims may or must
   appear in the Unsecured Payload of the SD-JWT VC and whether they
   may, must, or must not be selectively disclosable.  This
   specification does not define any vct values; instead it is expected
   that ecosystems using SD-JWT VCs define such values including the
   semantics of the respective claims and associated rules (e.g.,
   policies for issuing and validating credentials beyond what is
   defined in this specification).

   The following is a non-normative example of how vct is used to
   express a type:

   {
     "vct": "https://credentials.example.com/identity_credential"
   }

   For example, a value of https://credentials.example.com/
   identity_credential can be associated with rules that define that at
   least the registered JWT claims given_name, family_name, birthdate,
   and address must appear in the Unsecured Payload.  Additionally, the
   registered JWT claims email and phone_number, and the private claims
   is_over_18, is_over_21, and is_over_65 may be used.  The type might
   also indicate that any of the aforementioned claims can be
   selectively disclosable.

3.2.2.2.  Registered JWT Claims

   SD-JWT VCs MAY use any claim registered in the "JSON Web Token
   Claims" registry as defined in [RFC7519].

   If present, the following registered JWT claims MUST be included in
   the SD-JWT and MUST NOT be included in the Disclosures, i.e. cannot
   be selectively disclosed:

   *  iss
      -  REQUIRED.  The Issuer of the Verifiable Credential.  The value
         of iss MUST be a URI.  See [RFC7519] for more information.
   *  nbf
      -  OPTIONAL.  The time before which the Verifiable Credential MUST
         NOT be accepted before validating.  See [RFC7519] for more
         information.
   *  exp
      -  OPTIONAL.  The expiry time of the Verifiable Credential after
         which the Verifiable Credential is no longer valid.  See
         [RFC7519] for more information.
   *  cnf
      -  OPTIONAL unless cryptographic Key Binding is to be supported,
         in which case it is REQUIRED.  Contains the confirmation method
         identifying the proof of possession key as defined in
         [RFC7800].  It is RECOMMENDED that this contains a JWK as
         defined in Section 3.2 of [RFC7800].  For proof of
         cryptographic Key Binding, the Key Binding JWT in the
         presentation of the SD-JWT MUST be secured by the key
         identified in this claim.
   *  vct
      -  REQUIRED.  The type of the Verifiable Credential, e.g.,
         https://credentials.example.com/identity_credential, as defined
         in Section 3.2.2.1.1.
   *  status
      -  OPTIONAL.  The information on how to read the status of the
         Verifiable Credential.  See [I-D.ietf-oauth-status-list] for
         more information.

   The following registered JWT claims MAY be contained in the SD-JWT or
   in the Disclosures and MAY be selectively disclosed:

   *  sub
      -  OPTIONAL.  The identifier of the Subject of the Verifiable
         Credential.  The Issuer MAY use it to provide the Subject
         identifier known by the Issuer.  There is no requirement for a
         binding to exist between sub and cnf claims.
   *  iat
      -  OPTIONAL.  The time of issuance of the Verifiable Credential.
         See [RFC7519] for more information.

3.2.2.3.  Public JWT claims

   Additional public claims MAY be used in SD-JWT VCs depending on the
   application.

3.2.2.4.  SD-JWT VC without Selectively Disclosable Claims

   An SD-JWT VC MAY have no selectively disclosable claims.  In that
   case, the SD-JWT VC MUST NOT contain the _sd claim in the JWT body.
   It also MUST NOT have any Disclosures.

3.3.  Example

   The following is a non-normative example of the user data of an
   unsecured payload of an SD-JWT VC.

   {
     "vct": "https://credentials.example.com/identity_credential",
     "given_name": "John",
     "family_name": "Doe",
     "email": "johndoe@example.com",
     "phone_number": "+1-202-555-0101",
     "address": {
       "street_address": "123 Main St",
       "locality": "Anytown",
       "region": "Anystate",
       "country": "US"
     },
     "birthdate": "1940-01-01",
     "is_over_18": true,
     "is_over_21": true,
     "is_over_65": true
   }

   The following is a non-normative example of how the unsecured payload
   of the SD-JWT VC above can be used in an SD-JWT where the resulting
   SD-JWT VC contains only claims about the Subject that are selectively
   disclosable:

   {
     "_sd": [
       "09vKrJMOlyTWM0sjpu_pdOBVBQ2M1y3KhpH515nXkpY",
       "2rsjGbaC0ky8mT0pJrPioWTq0_daw1sX76poUlgCwbI",
       "EkO8dhW0dHEJbvUHlE_VCeuC9uRELOieLZhh7XbUTtA",
       "IlDzIKeiZdDwpqpK6ZfbyphFvz5FgnWa-sN6wqQXCiw",
       "JzYjH4svliH0R3PyEMfeZu6Jt69u5qehZo7F7EPYlSE",
       "PorFbpKuVu6xymJagvkFsFXAbRoc2JGlAUA2BA4o7cI",
       "TGf4oLbgwd5JQaHyKVQZU9UdGE0w5rtDsrZzfUaomLo",
       "jdrTE8YcbY4EifugihiAe_BPekxJQZICeiUQwY9QqxI",
       "jsu9yVulwQQlhFlM_3JlzMaSFzglhQG0DpfayQwLUK4"
     ],
     "iss": "https://example.com/issuer",
     "iat": 1683000000,
     "exp": 1883000000,
     "vct": "https://credentials.example.com/identity_credential",
     "_sd_alg": "sha-256",
     "cnf": {
       "jwk": {
         "kty": "EC",
         "crv": "P-256",
         "x": "TCAER19Zvu3OHF4j4W4vfSVoHIP1ILilDls7vCeGemc",
         "y": "ZxjiWWbZMQGHVWKVQ4hbSIirsVfuecCE6t4jT9F2HZQ"
       }
     }
   }

   Note that a cnf claim has been added to the SD-JWT payload to express
   the confirmation method of the Key Binding.

   above:

   Examples of what presentations of SD-JWT VCs might look like are
   provided in Section 4.2.

3.4.  Verification and Processing

   The recipient (Holder or Verifier) of an SD-JWT VC MUST process and
   verify an SD-JWT VC as described in Section 8 of
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt].

   If Key Binding is required (refer to the security considerations in
   Section 11.6 of [I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt]), the
   Verifier MUST verify the Key Binding JWT according to Section 8 of
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt].  To verify the Key Binding
   JWT, the cnf claim of the SD-JWT MUST be used.

   Furthermore, the recipient of the SD-JWT VC MUST validate the public
   verification key for the Issuer-signed JWT as defined in Section 3.5.

   If a schema is provided in the Type Metadata, a recipient MUST
   validate the schema as defined in Section 6.5.

   If there are no selectively disclosable claims, there is no need to
   process the _sd claim nor any Disclosures.

   If status is present in the verified payload of the SD-JWT, the
   status SHOULD be checked.  It depends on the Verifier policy to
   reject or accept a presentation of a SD-JWT VC based on the status of
   the Verifiable Credential.

   Any claims used that are not understood MUST be ignored.

   Additional validation rules MAY apply, but their use is out of the
   scope of this specification.

3.5.  Issuer-signed JWT Verification Key Validation

   A recipient of an SD-JWT VC MUST apply the following rules to
   validate that the public verification key for the Issuer-signed JWT
   corresponds to the iss value:

   *  JWT VC Issuer Metadata: If a recipient supports JWT VC Issuer
      Metadata and if the iss value contains an HTTPS URI, the recipient
      MUST obtain the public key using JWT VC Issuer Metadata as defined
      in Section 5.
   *  X.509 Certificates: If the recipient supports X.509 Certificates
      and the iss value contains an HTTPS URI, the recipient MUST
      1.  obtain the public key from the end-entity certificate of the
          certificates from the x5c header parameter of the Issuer-
          signed JWT and validate the X.509 certificate chain
          accordingly, and
      2.  ensure that the iss value matches a uniformResourceIdentifier
          SAN entry of the end-entity certificate or that the domain
          name in the iss value matches the dNSName SAN entry of the
          end-entity certificate.
   *  DID Document Resolution: If a recipient supports DID Document
      Resolution and if the iss value contains a DID [W3C.DID], the
      recipient MUST retrieve the public key from the DID Document
      resolved from the DID in the iss value.  In this case, if the kid
      JWT header parameter is present, the kid MUST be a relative or
      absolute DID URL of the DID in the iss value, identifying the
      public key.

   Separate specifications or ecosystem regulations MAY define rules
   complementing the rules defined above, but such rules are out of
   scope of this specification.  See Section 8.2 for security
   considerations.

   If a recipient cannot validate that the public verification key
   corresponds to the iss value of the Issuer-signed JWT, the SD-JWT VC
   MUST be rejected.

4.  Presenting Verifiable Credentials

   This section defines encoding, validation and processing rules for
   presentations of SD-JWT VCs.

4.1.  Key Binding JWT

   If the presentation of the SD-JWT VC includes a Key Binding JWT, the
   Key Binding JWT MUST adhere to the rules defined in Section 5.3 of
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt].

   The Key Binding JWT MAY include additional claims which, when not
   understood, MUST be ignored by the Verifier.

4.2.  Examples

   The following is a non-normative example of a presentation of the SD-
   JWT shown in Section 3.3 including a Key Binding JWT.  In this
   presentation, the Holder provides only the Disclosures for the
   address and is_over_65 claims.  Other claims are not disclosed to the
   Verifier.

   After validation, the Verifier will have the following processed SD-
   JWT payload available for further handling:

   {
     "iss": "https://example.com/issuer",
     "iat": 1683000000,
     "exp": 1883000000,

     }
   }

5.  JWT VC Issuer Metadata

   This specification defines the JWT VC Issuer Metadata to retrieve the
   JWT VC Issuer Metadata configuration of the Issuer of the SD-JWT VC.
   The Issuer is identified by the iss claim in the JWT.  Use of the JWT
   VC Issuer Metadata is OPTIONAL.

   Issuers publishing JWT VC Issuer Metadata MUST make a JWT VC Issuer
   Metadata configuration available at the location formed by inserting
   the well-known string /.well-known/jwt-vc-issuer between the host
   component and the path component (if any) of the iss claim value in
   the JWT.  The iss MUST be a case-sensitive URL using the HTTPS scheme
   that contains scheme, host and, optionally, port number and path
   components, but no query or fragment components.

5.1.  JWT VC Issuer Metadata Request

   A JWT VC Issuer Metadata configuration MUST be queried using an HTTP
   GET request at the path defined in Section 5.

   The following is a non-normative example of an HTTP request for the
   JWT VC Issuer Metadata configuration when iss is set to
   https://example.com:

   GET /.well-known/jwt-vc-issuer HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com

   If the iss value contains a path component, any terminating / MUST be
   removed before inserting /.well-known/ and the well-known URI suffix
   between the host component and the path component.

   The following is a non-normative example of a HTTP request for the
   JWT VC Issuer Metadata configuration when iss is set to
   https://example.com/tenant/1234:

   GET /.well-known/jwt-vc-issuer/tenant/1234 HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com

5.2.  JWT VC Issuer Metadata Response

   A successful response MUST use the 200 OK HTTP and return the JWT VC
   Issuer Metadata configuration using the application/json content
   type.

   An error response uses the applicable HTTP status code value.

   This specification defines the following JWT VC Issuer Metadata
   configuration parameters:

   *  issuer
      -  REQUIRED.  The Issuer identifier, which MUST be identical to
         the iss value in the JWT.
   *  jwks_uri
      -  OPTIONAL.  URL string referencing the Issuer's JSON Web Key
         (JWK) Set [RFC7517] document which contains the Issuer's public
         keys.  The value of this field MUST point to a valid JWK Set
         document.
   *  jwks
      -  OPTIONAL.  Issuer's JSON Web Key Set [RFC7517] document value,
         which contains the Issuer's public keys.  The value of this
         field MUST be a JSON object containing a valid JWK Set.

   JWT VC Issuer Metadata MUST include either jwks_uri or jwks in their
   JWT VC Issuer Metadata, but not both.

   It is RECOMMENDED that the JWT contains a kid JWT header parameter
   that can be used to look up the public key in the JWK Set included by
   value or referenced in the JWT VC Issuer Metadata.

   The following is a non-normative example of a JWT VC Issuer Metadata
   configuration including jwks:

   {
      "issuer":"https://example.com",
      "jwks":{
         "keys":[
            {
               "kid":"doc-signer-05-25-2022",
               "e":"AQAB",
               "n":"nj3YJwsLUFl9BmpAbkOswCNVx17Eh9wMO-_AReZwBqfaWFcfG
      HrZXsIV2VMCNVNU8Tpb4obUaSXcRcQ-VMsfQPJm9IzgtRdAY8NN8Xb7PEcYyk

               "kty":"RSA"
            }
         ]
      }
   }

   The following is a non-normative example of a JWT VC Issuer Metadata
   configuration including jwks_uri:

   {
      "issuer":"https://example.com",
      "jwks_uri":"https://jwt-vc-issuer.example.org/my_public_keys.jwks"
   }

   Additional JWT VC Issuer Metadata configuration parameters MAY also
   be used.

5.3.  JWT VC Issuer Metadata Validation

   The issuer value returned MUST be identical to the iss value of the
   JWT.  If these values are not identical, the data contained in the
   response MUST NOT be used.

6.  Type Metadata

   A SD-JWT VC type, i.e., the vct value, is associated with Type
   Metadata defining, for example, information about the type or a
   schema defining (see Section 6.5.1) which claims MAY or MUST appear
   in the SD-JWT VC.

   This section defines Type Metadata that can be associated with a type
   of a SD-JWT VC, as well as a method for retrieving the Type Metadata
   and processing rules.  This Type Metadata is intended to be used,
   among other things, for the following purposes:

   *  Developers of Issuers and Verifiers can use the Type Metadata to
      understand the semantics of the type and the associated rules.
      While in some cases, Issuers are the parties that define types,
      this is not always the case.  For example, a type can be defined
      by a standardization body or a community.
   *  Verifiers can use the Type Metadata to determine whether a
      credential is valid according to the rules of the type.  For
      example, a Verifier can check whether a credential contains all
      required claims and whether the claims are selectively
      disclosable.

   Type Metadata can be retrieved as described in Section 6.3.

6.1.  Type Metadata Example

   All examples in this section are non-normative.

   The following is an example of an SD-JWT VC payload, containing a vct
   claim with the value https://betelgeuse.example.com/
   education_credential:

   {
     "vct": "https://betelgeuse.example.com/education_credential",
     "vct#integrity": "sha256-WRL5ca_xGgX3c1VLmXfh-9cLlJNXN-TsMk-PmKjZ5t0",
     ...
   }

   Type Metadata for the type https://betelgeuse.example.com/
   education_credential can be retrieved using various mechanisms as
   described in Section 6.3.  For this example, the well-known URL as
   defined in Section 6.3.1 is used and the following Type Metadata
   Document is retrieved from the URL
   https://betelgeuse.example.com/.well-known/vct/education_credential:

   {
     "vct":"https://betelgeuse.example.com/education_credential",
     "name":"Betelgeuse Education Credential - Preliminary Version",
     "description":"This is our development version of the education credential. Don't panic.",
     "extends":"https://galaxy.example.com/galactic-education-credential-0.9",
     "extends#integrity":"sha256-9cLlJNXN-TsMk-PmKjZ5t0WRL5ca_xGgX3c1VLmXfh-WRL5",
     "schema_uri":"https://exampleuniversity.com/public/credential-schema-0.9",
     "schema_uri#integrity":"sha256-o984vn819a48ui1llkwPmKjZ5t0WRL5ca_xGgX3c1VLmXfh"
   }

   Note: The hash of the Type Metadata document shown in the second
   example must be equal to the one in the vct#integrity claim in the
   SD-JWT VC payload, WRL5ca_xGgX3c1VLmXfh-9cLlJNXN-TsMk-PmKjZ5t0.

6.2.  Type Metadata Format

   The Type Metadata document MUST be a JSON object.  The following
   properties are defined:

   *  name
      -  OPTIONAL.  A human-readable name for the type, intended for
         developers reading the JSON document.
   *  description
      -  OPTIONAL.  A human-readable description for the type, intended
         for developers reading the JSON document.
   *  extends
      -  OPTIONAL.  A URI of another type that this type extends, as
         described in Section 6.4.
   *  schema
      -  OPTIONAL.  An embedded JSON Schema document describing the
         structure of the Verifiable Credential as described in
         Section 6.5.1. schema MUST NOT be used if schema_uri is
         present.
   *  schema_uri
      -  OPTIONAL.  A URL pointing to a JSON Schema document describing
         the structure of the Verifiable Credential as described in
         Section 6.5.1. schema_uri MUST NOT be used if schema is
         present.

6.3.  Retrieving Type Metadata

6.3.1.  From a URL in the vct Claim

   A URI in the vct claim can be used to express a type.  If the type is
   a URL using the HTTPS scheme, Type Metadata can be retrieved from the
   URL https://<authority>/.well-known/vct/<type>, i.e., by inserting
   /.well-known/vct after the authority part of the URL.

   The Type Metadata is retrieved using the HTTP GET method.  The
   response MUST be a JSON object as defined in Section 6.2.

   If the claim vct#integrity is present in the SD-JWT VC, its value
   vct#integrity MUST be an "integrity metadata" string as defined in
   Section Section 7.

6.3.2.  From a Registry

   A Consumer MAY use a registry to retrieve Type Metadata for a SD-JWT
   VC type, e.g., if the type is not a HTTPS URL or if the Consumer does
   not have access to the URL.  The registry MUST be a trusted registry,
   i.e., the Consumer MUST trust the registry to provide correct Type
   Metadata for the type.

   The registry MUST provide the Type Metadata in the same format as
   described in Section 6.2.

6.3.3.  Using a Defined Retrieval Method

   Ecosystems MAY define additional methods for retrieving Type
   Metadata.  For example, a standardization body or a community MAY
   define a service which has to be used to retrieve Type Metadata based
   on a URN in the vct claim.

6.3.4.  From a Local Cache

   A Consumer MAY cache Type Metadata for a SD-JWT VC type.  If a hash
   for integrity protection is present in the Type Metadata as defined
   in Section 7, the Consumer MAY assume that the Type Metadata is
   static and can be cached indefinitely.  Otherwise, the Consumer MUST
   use the Cache-Control header of the HTTP response to determine how
   long the metadata can be cached.

6.3.5.  From Type Metadata Glue Documents

   Credentials MAY encode Type Metadata directly, providing it as "glue
   information" to the Consumer.

   For JSON-serialized JWS-based credentials, such Type Metadata
   documents MAY be included in the unprotected header of the JWS.  In
   this case, the key vctm MUST be used in the unprotected header and
   its value MUST be an array of base64url-encoded Type Metadata
   documents as defined in this specification.  Multiple documents MAY
   be included for providing a whole chain of types to the Consumer (see
   Section 6.4).

   A Consumer of a credential MAY use the documents in the vctm array
   instead of retrieving the respective Type Metadata elsewhere as
   follows:

   *  When resolving a vct in a credential, the Consumer MUST ensure
      that the vct claim in the credential matches the one in the Type
      Metadata document, and it MUST verify the integrity of the Type
      Metadata document as defined in Section 7.  The Consumer MUST NOT
      use the Type Metadata if no hash for integrity protection was
      provided in vct#integrity.
   *  When resolving an extends property in a Type Metadata document,
      the Consumer MUST ensure that the value of the extends property in
      the Type Metadata document matches that of the vct in the Type
      Metadata document, and it MUST verify the integrity of the Type
      Metadata document as defined in Section 7.  The Consumer MUST NOT
      use the Type Metadata if no hash for integrity protection was
      provided.

6.4.  Extending Type Metadata

   An SD-JWT VC type can extend another type.  The extended type is
   identified by the URI in the extends property.  Consumers MUST
   retrieve and process Type Metadata for the extended type before
   processing the Type Metadata for the extending type.

   The extended type MAY itself extend another type.  This can be used
   to create a chain or hierarchy of types.  The security considerations
   described in Section 8.3 apply in order to avoid problems with
   circular dependencies.

6.5.  Schema Type Metadata

6.5.1.  Schema Definition

   Schemas for Verifiable Credentials are contained in the schema or
   retrieved via the schema_uri Type Metadata parameters (as defined in
   Section 6.2).  A schema MUST be represented by a JSON Schema document
   according to draft version 2020-12 [JSON.SCHEMA.2020-12] or above.

   The schema of a Verifiable Credential MUST include all properties
   that are required by this specification and MUST NOT override their
   cardinality, JSON data type, or semantic intent.

   The following is a non-normative example of a JSON Schema document
   for the example in Section 3.3 requiring the presence of the cnf
   claim in an SD-JWT VC presentation:

   {
     "$schema":"https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
     "type":"object",
     "properties":{
       "vct":{
         "type":"string"
       },
       "iss":{
         "type":"string"
       },
       "nbf":{
         "type":"number"
       },
       "exp":{
         "type":"number"
       },
       "cnf":{
         "type":"object"
       },
       "status":{
         "type":"object"
       },
       "given_name":{
         "type":"string"
       },
       "family_name":{
         "type":"string"
       },
       "email":{
         "type":"string"
       },
       "phone_number":{
         "type":"string"
       },
       "address":{
         "type":"object",
         "properties":{
           "street_address":{
             "type":"string"
           },
           "locality":{
             "type":"string"
           },
           "region":{
             "type":"string"
           },
           "country":{
             "type":"string"
           }
         }
       },
       "birthdate":{
         "type":"string"
       },
       "is_over_18":{
         "type":"boolean"
       },
       "is_over_21":{
         "type":"boolean"
       },
       "is_over_65":{
         "type":"boolean"
       }
     },
     "required":[
       "iss",
       "vct",
       "cnf"
     ]
   }

   Note that iss and vct are always required by this specification.

6.5.2.  Schema Validation

   If a schema or schema_uri property is present, a Consumer MUST
   validate the JSON document resulting from the SD-JWT verification
   algorithm (as defined in Section 8 of
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt]) against the JSON Schema
   document provided by the schema or schema_uri property.

   If an extends property is present, the schema of the extended type
   MUST also be validated in the same manner.  This process includes
   validating all subsequent extended types recursively until a type is
   encountered that does not contain an extends property in its Type
   Metadata.  Each schema in this chain MUST be evaluated for a specific
   Verifiable Credential.

   If the schema validation fails for any of the types in the chain, the
   Consumer MUST reject the Verifiable Credential.

   The following is a non-normative example of a result JSON document
   after executing the SD-JWT verification algorithm that is validated
   against the JSON Schema document in the example provided in
   Section 6.5.1:

   {
     "vct":"https://credentials.example.com/identity_credential",
     "iss":"https://example.com/issuer",
     "iat":1683000000,
     "exp":1883000000,
     "sub":"6c5c0a49-b589-431d-bae7-219122a9ec2c",
     "address":{
       "country":"DE"
     },
     "cnf":{
       "jwk":{
         "kty":"EC",
         "crv":"P-256",
         "x":"TCAER19Zvu3OHF4j4W4vfSVoHIP1ILilDls7vCeGemc",
         "y":"ZxjiWWbZMQGHVWKVQ4hbSIirsVfuecCE6t4jT9F2HZQ"
       }
     }
   }

   Note, the example above does not contain any _sd_alg, _sd, or ...
   claims.

7.  Document Integrity

   Both the vct claim in the SD-JWT VC and the various URIs in the Type
   Metadata MAY be accompanied by a respective claim suffixed with
   #integrity, in particular:

   *  vct as defined in Section 3.2.2.2,
   *  extends as defined in Section 6.4
   *  schema_uri as defined in Section 6.5

   The value MUST be an "integrity metadata" string as defined in
   Section 3 of [W3C.SRI].  A Consumer of the respective documents MUST
   verify the integrity of the retrieved document as defined in
   Section 3.3.5 of [W3C.SRI].

8.  Security Considerations

   The Security Considerations in the SD-JWT specification
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt] apply to this
   specification.  Additionally, the following security considerations
   need to be taken into account when using SD-JWT VCs:

8.1.  Server-Side Request Forgery

   The JWT VC Issuer Metadata configuration is retrieved from the JWT VC
   Issuer by the Holder or Verifier.  Similar to other metadata
   endpoints, the URL for the retrieval MUST be considered an untrusted
   value and could be a vector for Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
   attacks.

   Before making a request to the JWT VC Issuer Metadata endpoint, the
   Holder or Verifier MUST validate the URL to ensure that it is a valid
   HTTPS URL and that it does not point to internal resources.  This
   requires, in particular, ensuring that the host part of the URL does
   not address an internal service (by IP address or an internal host
   name) and that, if an external DNS name is used, the resolved DNS
   name does not point to an internal IPv4 or IPv6 address.

   When retrieving the metadata, the Holder or Verifier MUST ensure that
   the request is made in a time-bound and size-bound manner to prevent
   denial of service attacks.  The Holder or Verifier MUST also ensure
   that the response is a valid JWT VC Issuer Metadata configuration
   document before processing it.

   Additional considerations can be found in [OWASP_SSRF].

8.2.  Ecosystem-specific Public Key Verification Methods

   When defining ecosystem-specific rules for the verification of the
   public key, as outlined in Section 3.5, it is critical that those
   rules maintain the integrity of the relationship between the iss
   value within the Issuer-signed JWT and the public keys of the Issuer.

   It MUST be ensured that for any given iss value, an attacker cannot
   influence the type of verification process used.  Otherwise, an
   attacker could attempt to make the Verifier use a verification
   process not intended by the Issuer, allowing the attacker to
   potentially manipulate the verification result to their advantage.

8.3.  Circular "extends" Dependencies of Types

   A type MUST NOT extend another type that extends (either directly or
   with steps in-between) the first type.  This would result in a
   circular dependency that could lead to infinite recursion when
   retrieving and processing the metadata.

   Consumers MUST detect such circular dependencies and reject the
   credential.

8.4.  Robust Retrieval of Type Metadata

   In Section 6.3, various methods for distributing and retrieving
   metadata are described.  Methods relying on a network connection may
   fail due to network issues or unavailability of a network connection
   due to offline usage of credentials, temporary server outages, or
   denial of service attacks on the metadata server.

   Consumers SHOULD therefore implement a local cache as described in
   Section 6.3.4 if possible.  Such a cache MAY be populated with
   metadata before the credential is used.

   Issuers MAY provide glue documents as described in Section 6.3.5 to
   provide metadata directly with the credential and avoid the need for
   network requests.

   These measures allow the Consumers to continue to function even if
   the metadata server is temporarily unavailable and avoid privacy
   issues as described in Section 10.1.

9.  Privacy Considerations

   The Privacy Considerations in the SD-JWT specification
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt] apply to this
   specification.  Additionally, the following privacy considerations
   need to be taken into account when using SD-JWT VCs.

9.1.  Unlinkability

   The Privacy Considerations in Section 12.5 of
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt] apply especially to the cnf
   claim.

9.2.  Verifiable Credential Type Identifier

   Issuers and Holders have to be aware that while this specification
   supports selective disclosure of claims of a given SD-JWT VC, the vct
   claim is not selectively disclosable.  In certain situations this
   could lead to unwanted leakage of additional context information.

   In general, Issuers are advised to choose vct values following data
   minimization principles.  For example, government Issuers issuing an
   SD-JWT VC to their citizens to enable them to prove their age, might
   consider using a vct value that does not allow third-parties to infer
   additional personal information about the Holder, e.g., country of
   residency or citizenship.

   Additionally, Holders have to be informed that, besides the actual
   requested claims, the vct information is shared with the Verifier.

9.3.  Issuer Phone-Home

   A malicious Issuer can choose the Issuer identifier of the SD-JWT VC
   to enable tracking the usage behavior of the Holder if the Issuer
   identifier is Holder-specific and if the resolution of the key
   material to verify the Issuer-signed JWT requires the Verifier to
   phone home to the Issuer.

   For example, a malicious Issuer could generate a unique value for the
   Issuer identifier per Holder, e.g., https://example.com/issuer/
   holder-1234 and host the JWT VC Issuer Metadata.  The Verifier would
   create a HTTPS GET request to the Holder-specific well-known URI when
   the SD-JWT VC is verified.  This would allow the malicious Issuer to
   keep track where and how often the SD-JWT VC was used.

   Verifiers are advised to establish trust in an SD-JWT VC by pinning
   specific Issuer identifiers and should monitor suspicious behaviour
   such as frequently rotating Issuer identifiers.  If such behaviour
   was detected, Verifiers are advised to reject SD-JWT VCs issued by
   such Issuers.

   Holders are advised to reject SD-JWT VCs if they contain easily
   correlatable information in the Issuer identifier.

10.  Relationships to Other Documents

   This specification defines validation and processing rules for
   verifiable credentials using JSON payloads and secured by SD-JWT
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt].  Other specifications
   exist that define their own verifiable credential formats; for
   example, W3C Verifiable Credential Data Model (VCDM) 2.0 [W3C.VCDM]
   defines a data model for verifiable credentials encoded as JSON-LD,
   and ISO/IEC 18013-5:2021 [ISO.18013-5] defines a representation of
   verifiable credentials in the mobile document (mdoc) format encoded
   as CBOR and secured using COSE.

10.1.  Privacy-Preserving Retrieval of Type Metadata

   In Section 6.3, various methods for distributing and retrieving Type
   Metadata are described.  For methods which rely on a network
   connection to a URL (e.g., provided by an Issuer), third parties
   (like the Issuer) may be able to track the usage of a credential by
   observing requests to the Type Metadata URL.

   Consumers SHOULD prefer methods for retrieving Type Metadata that do
   not leak information about the usage of a credential to third
   parties.  The recommendations in Section 8.4 apply.

Appendix B.  Examples

   Important: The following examples are not normative and provided for
   illustrative purposes only.  In particular, neither the structure of
   the claims nor the selection of selectively disclosable claims are
   normative.

   Line breaks have been added for readability.

B.1.  Example 1: Person Identification Data (PID) Credential

   This example shows how the artifacts defined in this specification
   could be used to represent the concept of a Person Identification
   Data (PID) [EUDIW.ARF] using the data of a German citizen.

   Key Binding is applied using the Holder's public key passed in a cnf
   claim in the SD-JWT.

   The following data about the citizen comprises the input JWT Claims
   Set used by the Issuer:

   {
     "vct": "https://bmi.bund.example/credential/pid/1.0",
     "given_name": "Erika",
     "family_name": "Mustermann",
     "birthdate": "1963-08-12",
     "source_document_type": "id_card",
     "address": {
       "street_address": "Heidestraße 17",
       "locality": "Köln",
       "postal_code": "51147",
       "country": "DE"
     },
     "nationalities": [
       "DE"
     ],
     "gender": "female",
     "birth_family_name": "Gabler",
     "place_of_birth": {
       "locality": "Berlin",
       "country": "DE"
     },
     "also_known_as": "Schwester Agnes",
     "age_equal_or_over": {
       "12": true,

   The following is the payload of a corresponding Key Binding JWT:

   {
     "nonce": "1234567890",
     "aud": "https://example.com/verifier",
     "iat": 1726175102,
     "sd_hash": "76L0OmMTr9Yzmd8xrcAG-skETDLhPa0iE3zkz2gFCcI"
   }

   After validation, the Verifier will have the following processed SD-
   JWT payload available for further handling:

   {
     "iss": "https://example.com/issuer",
     "iat": 1683000000,
     "exp": 1883000000,
     "vct": "https://bmi.bund.example/credential/pid/1.0",
     "age_equal_or_over": {
       "18": true
     },
     "cnf": {
       "jwk": {
         "kty": "EC",
         "crv": "P-256",
         "x": "TCAER19Zvu3OHF4j4W4vfSVoHIP1ILilDls7vCeGemc",
         "y": "ZxjiWWbZMQGHVWKVQ4hbSIirsVfuecCE6t4jT9F2HZQ"
       }
     },
     "nationalities": [
